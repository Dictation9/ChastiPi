## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi (any model)
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Internet connection for initial setup

### Quick Start

1. **Clone or download this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd raspberry-pi-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the dashboards**
   - Open your web browser
   - Navigate to `http://your-pi-ip:5000`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:5000`
   - Use the navigation to switch between Device Dashboard and System Monitor

## Configuration

### Network Access

The app runs on `0.0.0.0:5000` by default, making it accessible from other devices on your network.

### Customization

You can modify the following in `app.py`:
- **Port**: Change `port=5000` to your preferred port
- **Update intervals**: Modify the JavaScript update intervals in `static/js/dashboard.js`
- **Process count**: Change the number of processes displayed in the API

### Security Considerations

For production use, consider:
- Adding authentication
- Using HTTPS
- Running behind a reverse proxy (nginx)
- Setting up a firewall

```

## API Endpoints

### Device Management
- `GET /` - Device management dashboard
- `GET /api/chastity-status` - Device status and key information

### System Monitoring
- `GET /system` - System monitoring dashboard
- `GET /api/system-info` - System resource information
- `GET /api/processes` - Top processes by CPU usage

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. **New API endpoints**: Add routes to `app.py`
2. **Device dashboard components**: Modify `templates/index.html`
3. **System monitor components**: Modify `templates/system.html`
4. **Styling**: Update `static/css/style.css`
5. **Device dashboard functionality**: Extend `static/js/dashboard.js`
6. **System monitor functionality**: Extend `static/js/system.js`

### Testing

The application includes error handling and will display appropriate messages if:
- System information cannot be retrieved
- Processes cannot be listed
- Network connectivity is lost

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**
   ```bash
   # Find and kill the process using port 5000
   sudo lsof -i :5000
   sudo kill -9 <PID>
   ```

2. **Permission denied**
   ```bash
   # Make sure you have proper permissions
   sudo chmod +x app.py
   ```

3. **Cannot access from other devices**
   - Check your firewall settings
   - Verify the Pi's IP address
   - Ensure the app is running on `0.0.0.0`

### Performance Tips

- Device dashboard updates every 6 seconds by default
- System monitor updates every 2 seconds by default
- Process list updates every 4 seconds
- Adjust these intervals in the respective JavaScript files if needed
- Monitor your Pi's resources while running the dashboards
