# Email-First Keyholder Management

## 🌟 **Why Email-First?**

ChastiPi uses an **email-first approach** for keyholder management because it solves the most common problem: **remote access without complex network setup**.

### **The Problem**
- Keyholders are often not on the same WiFi network as the Raspberry Pi
- Port forwarding and VPN setup can be complex and insecure
- Web interfaces require network configuration to work remotely
- Mobile access to web interfaces can be unreliable

### **The Solution**
- **Email works from anywhere** - No network setup required
- **Mobile friendly** - Reply from any email app on any device
- **Secure** - Uses existing email security infrastructure
- **Reliable** - Email is a proven, stable communication method
- **Instant** - Real-time notifications and responses

## 📧 **How It Works**

### **1. Request Made**
```
User requests key release from Raspberry Pi
↓
System generates unique request ID
↓
Email notification sent to keyholder
```

### **2. Keyholder Receives Email**
```
Subject: 🔐 Key Request: Device Name - 2h
Body: 
- Request details
- Simple reply commands
- Web interface link (local network only)
```

### **3. Keyholder Replies**
```
Keyholder replies with simple command:
- "APPROVE"
- "DENY"
- "EXTEND 2"
- "REDUCE 1"
- "EMERGENCY"
```

### **4. System Processes Reply**
```
Email reply received via webhook
↓
Command parsed and validated
↓
Action executed (approve/deny/extend/etc.)
↓
Confirmation email sent to keyholder
```

### **5. User Gets Result**
```
If approved: User receives access token
If denied: User gets denial notification
If extended: Duration updated automatically
```

## 🎯 **Email Commands**

### **Basic Commands**
```
APPROVE          - Approve the request
DENY             - Deny the request
EMERGENCY        - Emergency release
```

### **Time Modification**
```
EXTEND 2         - Extend by 2 hours
EXTEND 30        - Extend by 30 minutes
REDUCE 1         - Reduce to 1 hour
REDUCE 30        - Reduce to 30 minutes
```

### **With Reasons**
```
DENY - not enough time
DENY - too busy today
APPROVE - but be quick
EXTEND 1 - take your time
```

## 📱 **Mobile Experience**
